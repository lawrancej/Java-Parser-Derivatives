Java-Parser-Derivatives
=======================

Derivative-based parsing for Java

This project presents the sample code from the Maniagnosis
(http://maniagnosis.crsr.net) posts on derivative parsing.

The net.crsr.derivative.a package contains the code from
the first post, Parsing with derivatives: introduction
(http://maniagnosis.crsr.net/2012/04/parsing-with-derivatives-introduction.html).
