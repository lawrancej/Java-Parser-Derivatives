Java-Parser-Derivatives
=======================

Derivative-based parsing for Java

This project presents the sample code from the Maniagnosis
(http://maniagnosis.crsr.net) posts on derivative parsing.

The net.crsr.derivative.a package contains the code from
the first post, "Parsing with derivatives: introduction"
(http://maniagnosis.crsr.net/2012/04/parsing-with-derivatives-introduction.html).

The package net.crsr.derivative.b contains the
code from "Parsing with derivatives: recursion"
(http://maniagnosis.crsr.net/2012/04/parsing-with-derivatives-recursion.html).

The code from "Parsing with derivatives: compaction"
(http://maniagnosis.crsr.net/2012/05/parsing-with-derivatives-compaction.html)
is in net.crsr.derivative.c.

For a summary and list of the entire series, see "Parsing with
Derivatives", http://maniagnosis.crsr.net/p/parsing-with-derivatives.html.
